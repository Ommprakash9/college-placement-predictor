Create a full-scale, production-style College Placement Prediction Web Application using Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit.

GOAL:
Build a modern, visually stunning, multi-section web app that predicts whether a student will be placed, with a futuristic dark theme, smooth animations, and a professional layout suitable for campus placements and resumes.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Machine Learning
   - Use Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn.
   - Predict student placement (Placed / Not Placed).
   - Use Logistic Regression as the baseline model.
   - Add Random Forest as an optional advanced model.
   - Perform data preprocessing, feature scaling, train-test split.
   - Show model accuracy and evaluation metrics.
   - Save the trained model and scaler.

2. Dataset
   - Read data from dataset/placement.csv.
   - Features:
     • CGPA
     • Internships
     • Projects
     • Skill Level (1–10)
     • Communication Skills (1–10)
   - Target:
     • Placed (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
- dataset/placement.csv
- model/placement_model.pkl
- model/scaler.pkl
- train_model.py
- app.py
- .streamlit/config.toml
- requirements.txt
- README.md

WEB APP (STREAMLIT) – MUST BE LARGE & MULTI-SECTION:
Create the following sections with clear navigation:

1. Hero Section
   - Full-width animated hero title
   - Subheading explaining the project
   - Smooth fade-in animation

2. About the Project
   - Explain the real-world placement problem
   - Why machine learning is used
   - Clean card-based layout

3. Student Input Panel
   - Sidebar with sliders and inputs
   - Smooth transitions on interaction

4. Placement Prediction Section
   - Animated loading spinner
   - Prediction result shown inside a glowing card
   - Placement probability bar animation

5. Model Insights Section
   - Display accuracy
   - Confusion matrix visualization
   - Feature importance (if Random Forest used)

6. Analytics Dashboard
   - Graphs for CGPA vs Placement
   - Internships vs Placement
   - Clean, minimal charts

7. Future Improvements Section
   - Add suggestions like deep learning, real college data
   - Card layout with icons

8. Footer
   - Project credits
   - Tech stack used

THEME & ANIMATION REQUIREMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Use a custom Streamlit dark theme via .streamlit/config.toml
- Neon accent color (cyan / electric blue)
- Custom CSS animations:
  • fade-in
  • slide-up
  • glowing cards
- Card-based UI
- Smooth transitions (no clutter)
- Professional, startup-like design (NOT childish)

UI/UX RULES:
- Sidebar for inputs, main area for output
- Use emojis minimally and professionally
- Animations should be smooth and subtle
- Code must be clean, modular, and commented

DOCUMENTATION:
- Create a professional README.md explaining:
  • Problem statement
  • Tech stack
  • ML workflow
  • How to run the app in Replit
- Include resume-ready project description

FINAL REQUIREMENT:
- The project should look like a REAL product
- It must impress campus placement interviewers
- Code should be beginner-friendly but professional
- Explain how to run everything inside Replit

Generate the complete working project with clean code, animations, and modern UI.
