Upgrade and enhance my existing College Placement Prediction project without rebuilding it from scratch.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Keep the current theme, color palette, layout, and branding EXACTLY the same.
- Do NOT remove or rewrite existing sections.
- Do NOT change the core ML logic or prediction pipeline.
- Only EXTEND the project with new features and advanced UI/UX.

GOAL:
Transform this project into a highly polished, product-level AI application with advanced features, rich animations, and a premium feel suitable for campus placements and resumes.

FEATURE ENHANCEMENTS (ADD ALL):

1. Smart Career Insights
   - After prediction, generate personalized insights explaining:
     • Why the model predicted this result
     • Which factors helped the most
     • Which factors reduced chances
   - Animate insights appearing one by one.

2. Skill Gap & Benchmarking
   - Compare user profile against:
     • Average placed student
     • Top 10% placed students
   - Animated comparison bars and labels.

3. What-If Scenario Simulator
   - Allow user to tweak one parameter at a time (CGPA, skills, internships).
   - Update placement probability dynamically with animated delta (+/−%).
   - Keep original prediction intact.

4. Career Roadmap Generator
   - Generate a 30-60-90 day improvement plan.
   - Show steps using animated cards and progress indicators.

5. Advanced Analytics Dashboard
   - Animate charts loading smoothly.
   - Add trend graphs for CGPA vs placement probability.
   - Animate feature importance bars sequentially.

6. Profile Visualization
   - Add animated radar / spider chart for user profile.
   - Draw axes and data gradually.
   - Add hover tooltips explaining each metric.

UI & ANIMATION UPGRADES:

7. Section-Based Scroll Animations
   - Fade-in / slide-up animations when sections enter viewport.
   - Ensure animations trigger only once.

8. Micro-Interactions
   - Subtle hover glow on cards and buttons.
   - Input sliders react visually when adjusted.
   - Smooth page transitions between sections.

9. Result Presentation Upgrade
   - Animate probability counter (0 → final value).
   - Glowing success / warning state based on confidence.
   - Confidence label: Low / Medium / High.

10. Visual Polish
   - Glassmorphism cards (blur + transparency).
   - Consistent spacing and typography hierarchy.
   - Subtle animated dividers between sections.

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Animations must be smooth and professional (not flashy).
- Keep performance fast and responsive.
- Code must be clean, modular, and well-commented.
- Beginner-friendly but industry-grade structure.

FINAL RESULT:
- The app should feel like a premium AI career-guidance product.
- Significantly more advanced than a typical ML college project.
- Strong visual and technical impression for placement interviews.

Apply all enhancements carefully and explain what was added.
