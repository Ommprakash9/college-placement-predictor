Upgrade and enhance the existing College Placement Prediction web app to a premium, product-level experience while keeping the same dark neon theme and core ML logic.

GOAL:
Transform this project from a simple ML demo into a visually rich, highly interactive, advanced web application suitable for top-tier campus placements.

DO NOT rebuild from scratch.
DO NOT remove existing functionality.
ONLY enhance and extend the current project.

ADVANCED UI & ANIMATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. Page-Level Animations
   - Add smooth scroll-based reveal animations (fade-up, slide-in) for every major section.
   - Sections should animate when they enter the viewport.
   - Use CSS keyframes and intersection-style logic where possible.

2. Hero Section Upgrade
   - Add animated gradient glow behind the title.
   - Add subtle floating particles or noise background effect.
   - Add animated underline or typing-style subtitle.

3. Input Interaction Enhancements
   - Animate sliders and number inputs when values change.
   - Add micro-animations (pulse / glow) on active inputs.
   - Add real-time preview indicators reacting to user input.

4. Prediction Animation (VERY IMPORTANT)
   - When “Run Prediction” is clicked:
     • Lock inputs
     • Show multi-step loading animation (Analyzing → Evaluating → Predicting)
     • Animate probability bar filling smoothly from 0 to result
     • Add success / warning / danger color transitions
   - Add subtle sound or pulse animation (optional, visual only if sound not supported).

5. Advanced Result Visualization
   - Add animated circular progress ring for placement probability.
   - Add confidence meter (Low / Medium / High).
   - Add dynamic recommendation cards that animate in sequence.

6. Profile Analysis (Upgrade This Section)
   - Add animated radar chart that appears after prediction.
   - Animate each axis drawing one by one.
   - Add tooltips explaining each metric.

7. Model Insights & Explainability
   - Animate feature importance bars sequentially.
   - Add hover explanations: “Why this feature matters”.
   - Add toggle to switch between Logistic Regression and Random Forest (if already present).

8. Career Guidance Section (NEW)
   - Add a new section:
     “What Should You Improve Next?”
   - Use prediction + feature importance to generate personalized improvement roadmap.
   - Animate checklist completion bars.

9. Global UI Polish
   - Add animated section dividers.
   - Add glassmorphism cards with blur and glow.
   - Improve spacing, hierarchy, and typography for premium feel.
   - Maintain neon cyan / electric blue accent colors.

10. Performance & UX
   - Ensure animations are smooth and not distracting.
   - Keep load time fast.
   - Ensure responsiveness on laptop screens.

CODE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Modularize UI code where possible.
- Add clear comments explaining animations and logic.
- Keep beginner-readable but professional structure.

FINAL RESULT:
- The app should feel like a real startup product.
- UI and animations should impress recruiters immediately.
- This should look significantly more advanced than a typical college ML project.

Implement all enhancements cleanly and explain any new sections added.
